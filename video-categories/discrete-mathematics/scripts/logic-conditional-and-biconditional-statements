I will now be introducing conditional statements. If you think that terminology sounds familiar, it is probably because if-else statements are conditional statements. A conditional statement has the form, “If p, then q” and is denoted p⟹q. This is read as, “If p, then q.” or “p implies q” or “q is sufficient for p”. Meaning, if p is true, then q must be true as well. Essentially, you’re being guaranteed that every time p is true, q will also be true.
The classic example is with a student and a teacher. Your teacher tells you that if you study she will promise to give you a good grade on your upcoming exam. That is, p=“I studied” and q=“I received a good grade on my exam”. Leading to the conditional statement of p⟹q = “If I study, then I will receive a good grade on my exam.” So lets turn our attention to the truth table.

Case1: p=T and q=T, which I will abbreviate as TT, make sense right? You were promised that if you studied, you will receive a good grade. Since you studied and received a good grade, the teacher told the truth, meaning the conditional statement was TRUE for case1.

Case2: TF, you studied, but your teacher did not give you a good grade! Therefore, you're teacher lied to you, meaning the conditional statement was FALSE for case2.

Case3 & Case4: FT && FF, since your teacher didn’t promise you anything, they didn’t lie to you. Since they didn’t lie to you, they told the truth. Therefore, the conditional was true for both case3 and case4. Remember, we were only promised that if we studied we would receive a good grade. The teacher doesn’t say that if you don’t study you will receive a bad grade. See the difference? We will elaborate on this concept in the next video.


Another type of conditional statement is called the biconditional. This defined as (p⟹q)∧(q⟹p), here is the corresponding truth table. Currently, we don’t have any applications for this, but this concept is important for future videos.
