I want to start this video off by stating that propositions adhere to the same algebraic laws as sets! The conjunction in logic is similar to the intersection in set theory. Likewise, the disjunction in logic is similar to the union in set theory. That means, you don’t have to learn new laws! :D

1. Idempotent Laws: `p∨p≣p,   p∧p≣p``
2. Identity Laws: `p∨F≣p,   p∨T≣T,   p∧F≣F,   p∧T≣p`
3. Complement Laws: `p∨¬p≣T,   ¬T≣F,   p∧¬p≣T,   ¬F≣T`
4. Involution Law: `¬¬p≣p`
5. Associative Laws: `(p∨q)∨r≣p∨(q∨r),   (p∧q)∧r≣p∧(q∧r)`
6. Commutative Laws: `p∨q≣q∨p,   p∧q≣q∧p`
7. Distributive Laws: `p∨(q∧r)≣(p∨q)∧(p∨r),   p∧(q∨r)≣(p∧q)∨(p∧r)`
8. DeMorgan’s Laws: `¬(p∨q)≣¬p∧¬q,   ¬(p∧q)≣¬p∨¬q`

If you want to practice you skills in logic, I highly recommend constructing truth tables for these laws! However, there will be more examples in future videos to fully learn these skills.
